### HTML Web App Unity Fund Prototype

\\ Prototype of a digital ROCAs system
\\ Backend uses soroban_sdk for crowd funding smart contract system, needs to be integrated into frontend

Unity Fund leverages smart contracts to facilitate secure, decentralized group lending, connecting users worldwide for seamless, trusted ROSCA contributions.

Unity Fund fits the Transform Finance Track as it achieves Stellar’s goal of making finance more accessible, providing services that cater to a large demographic of people, particularly Muslim and Christian, who have very limited existing access to interest-free finance. It also aligns with Stellar’s underlying ethos to support underrepresented communities. It utilises Stellar’s payment functionality to expand the idea of a Rotating Savings and Credit Associations to a global platform to service diaspora people so they can retain their community financing across borders. It also leverages blockchain and smart contract technology as it adds an element of transparency and reduces counter-party risk which reinforces and guarantees the foundation of trust that community finance is built on. Overall, this is an untapped area in finance which would help a large demographic.

Unity Fund is a digital Rotating Savings and Credit Association platform which essentially links communities of people (particularly those looking for interest-free alternatives in finance) and takes a small deposit from each member of the group at regular intervals. At each interval, the money collected is transferred to a given member of the group, providing them liquidity at that time and this rotates so that each member of the group is provided with funding once in the cycle. This uses blockchain technology by having the group set up on a smart contract so it automatically takes the deposit from each member at the given interval, adding automation and guaranteeing payment, and then distributes the funds to the relevant member at each interval. Stellar wallets makes this possible across borders as they have foreign exchange capabilities, so the central transactions are carried out in XLM and each member can hold that in their wallet and transfer to a local currency if necessary.
